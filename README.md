## Purpose of this Repository:

The primary objective of this application is to:

The main purpose of this repository is to host the source code for an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the health sector through digitalization. This application stands out by providing unique features focused on enhancing user convenience and promoting efficient healthcare services.

*   **Pharmacy Locator:** Users can easily locate nearby pharmacies on a map, allowing them to find medication and essential supplies quickly and conveniently.

*   **Ambulance Request and Real-Time Tracking:** The app includes a critical feature that allows users to call an ambulance directly. More importantly, users can track the real-time location of the ambulance, ensuring transparency and reducing the anxiety of waiting.

*   This repository is a platform for the collaboration and continued development of this project. We believe in the power of open-source and invite developers and contributors to join us in refining this application, thereby shaping the future of healthcare.

## Frameworks Used

The application is built using **Flutter**, a robust, open-source UI software development kit created by Google. Flutter was chosen for its capability to build beautiful, natively compiled applications for both iOS and Android from a single codebase, significantly accelerating the development process. Dart, a language designed to be easy-to-learn yet powerful in execution, has been used in conjunction with Flutter.

## Installation guide

*   The flutter SDK we've used is:
`flutter 2.19.6 sdk`

*   We need to install the latest version of android studio: https://developer.android.com/studio

*   Last, we need to connect our phone via USB hub in our device in order to run the simulation there. Else, we need to install emulators (iOS/Android) and run it directly from there. For more details check: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator
